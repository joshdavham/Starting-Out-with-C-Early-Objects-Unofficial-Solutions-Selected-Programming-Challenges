# Starting Out with C++: Early Objects -- Unofficial Solutions, Selected Programming Challenges

This repository includes my personal solutions to the 7th Edition of Tony Gaddis's *Starting Out with C++: Early Objects*.

Note that solutions were only created for chapters 2-8, 10 as I was using this textbook soley for learning the basics of C++. The other chapters contain material relevant either to more advanced C++ or to basic data structures and algorithms concepts.

You can purchase the newest edition of Tony Gaddis's *Starting Out with C++: Early Objects* [here](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Early-Objects-10th/dp/0135235006/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) (I highly recommend this book!).
